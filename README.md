## About
I've made this game using the Unity Game Engine. The concept is inspired from an existing game called "Flappy Bird". There's a point to note that this isn't the final product and is not meant to be published on any of the App Stores.


## How to play?
Tap anywhere on the screen to make the bird fly.
